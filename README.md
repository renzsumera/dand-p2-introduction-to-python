# Introduction to Python
## Overview
Used Python to explore data related to bike share systems in Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Code was written to import the date and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. A script was written that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

## Dataset

  - Start Time
